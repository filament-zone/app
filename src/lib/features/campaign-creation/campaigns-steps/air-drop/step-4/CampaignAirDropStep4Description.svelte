	<Typography variant="h5">Airdrop Campaign Overview</Typography>
	<Typography variant="h6">
		To celebrate our upcoming launch, EtherLend is excited to announce our EtherLend Genesis
		Airdrop, designed to reward our early adopters and supporters. As we gear up for our full launch
		on Ethereum, this airdrop is an opportunity to distribute tokens to those who believe in our
		vision and actively participate in the DeFi ecosystem.
	</Typography>
	<br />
	<Typography variant="h6">
		The EtherLend Genesis Airdrop will distribute a total of 10 million ELND tokens (10% of the
		total supply) to eligible users. By participating in our ecosystem, users can earn a portion of
		this allocation based on their engagement with lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision
		activities.
	</Typography>
	<br />
	<Typography variant="h5">Eligibility Criteria</Typography>
	<Typography variant="h6">
		Eligibility for the EtherLend Genesis Airdrop is based on several DeFi-related activities across
		the Ethereum network. These criteria include:
		<br />
		1. Lending ETH or other assets: Users who have lent assets to various Ethereum-based DeFi protocols
		over the past 6 months.
		<br />
		2. Borrowing Assets: Users who have borrowed assets through Ethereum-based protocols.
		<br />
		3. Providing Liquidity: Participants in Ethereum liquidity pools, particularly in EtherLend or partner
		pools.
		<br />
		4. Holding ELND: Early backers and token holders of our native ELND token.
	</Typography>
	<br />
	<Typography variant="h6">
		Each criterion will be weighted to reflect the user’s contribution to the DeFi ecosystem, and
		token rewards will be allocated based on activity level and engagement.
	</Typography>
	<br />
	<Typography variant="h5">Vision & Methodology</Typography>
	<Typography variant="h6">
		At EtherLend, we believe that decentralization and financial autonomy are the future. The
		EtherLend Genesis Airdrop is not just a distribution of tokens—it’s an invitation to help shape
		the future of decentralized lending. By rewarding early contributors, we aim to foster a
		thriving community that will actively participate in the governance and growth of the EtherLend
		protocol.
	</Typography>
	<br />
	<Typography variant="h6">
		Through this airdrop, we are building a foundation of decentralized ownership. ELND holders will
		have governance rights within the protocol, allowing them to propose and vote on key decisions,
		from protocol upgrades to new asset listings.
	</Typography>
	<br />
	<Typography variant="h6">
		This airdrop campaign is just the first step in our broader strategy to reward active
		participants in the DeFi space and foster a user-centric, decentralized future. We are committed
		to building a protocol that serves the community’s needs, and we invite you to join us in this
		journey as we redefine what decentralized lending can achieve.
